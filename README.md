This is my first full stack project.
It is a work in progress, fixing and updating as I go. The end goal is for users to upload videos to pinned spots on the map for other users to view.
Here is a list of what I am currently using for each system:
    Render for domain host
    MongoDB for pin storage
    Backblaze B2 for media storage
    Cloudinary for streaming/calling objects

As I mentioned this is a work in progress, I am learning as I go.
